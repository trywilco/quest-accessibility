              is not accessible to everyone. We want to ensure that our app provides
              a seamless experience to all users, including those with
              disabilities.
          - text: To figure out what issues we have, we will use a tool called [Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/) inside the Chrome DevTools. It's a tool
              that audits the accessibility, performance, and other aspects of
              our app.
          - text: So let's try it out on our anythink frontend app.
          - text: Open the dev tools and click on the lighthouse tab, choose Accessability and run the audit, let me know once the report is ready.
